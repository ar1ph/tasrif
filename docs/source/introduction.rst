Introduction
============

Tasrif is a toolkit that aims to make processing of eHealth data fast and
convenient for users.

To this end, it provides a set of commonly used functions packaged into reusable
components called **Operators**.

Operators are not meant to work in isolation; they can be chained together to
process data in a **Pipeline**.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to get you started with
using Tasrif for your processing needs.
